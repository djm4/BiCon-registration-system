BiCon registration system for BiCon 2010/10 ICB

This is the PHP code for the BiCon registration system for 2010, released in the
hope that it will be useful to future teams. It is heavily BiCon 2010-centric, 
and will need modification for other events, notably:

* All e-mail addresses are BiCon 2010 ones
* All URLs are BiCon 2010 ones
* Paypal details are for BiCon 2010
* The pricing structure and dates covered are BiCon 2010-specific
* BiCon 2010 ran as a joint venuture with 10 ICB, which most don't
* BiCon 2010 ran alongside the first one-day BiReCon, and so the
  registration system was structured to allow registration for both
  events. This will be an unnecessary complication for most BiCons.
* The Accommodation table in the database is specific to BiCon 2010

To install this you need to point a web server (preferably a secure one)
at the /docs/ folder. You also need to:

* Copy the /inc/config.inc.sample file to /inc/config.inc, and give it 
  appropriate values. 
* Run the /sql/server.create and /sql/tables.create SQL statements 
  on your copy of MySQL to create the database (note that you need to give
  a password to server.create that's the same as the one you put in the
  config.inc file).
* Create whatever folder you've set as the $logfilepath in config.inc, and
  make sure that it's writeable by the web server.
* Install the JanRain OpenID library (http://www.janrain.com/openid-enabled),
  or find some other way to handle authentication and authorisation for
the admin site
